    //Rules for instance varables 
    //1. Instance variables are declared inside the class but outside the method, constructor or any block.
    //2. Instance variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the object is destroyed.
    //3. Instance variables can be accessed directly by calling the variable name or by using the object reference variable.
    //4. Instance variables are initialized to default values if not explicitly initialized by the programmer. The default values are 0 for numeric types, false for boolean
    //   and null for object references.
    //5. Instance variables can be accessed by all the methods in the class and can be used to store the state of an object.
    //6 instance varaibles values can be changed from object to object 
    //7 Instance varaibles are stored in Heap memory and they are called as Object variables or attributes of the class.

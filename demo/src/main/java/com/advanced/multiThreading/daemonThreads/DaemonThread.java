    /*
     * Daemon threads are background threads that help the JVM perform
     * supporting tasks such as garbage collection.
     * Main objective of daemon therads is to provide support for non-daemon threads, such as main thread.
     * By default main thread is always non-daemon and for all the remaining threads daemon nature will be inherited from parent to child.
     * i.e if the parent threda is daemon then automatically child thread is also daemon.
     * If the parent thread is non-daemon then child thread will also be non-daemon.
     * 
     * Important behavior:
     * - A thread is non-daemon by default.
     * - Once set as a daemon thread, it runs in the background.
     * - If only daemon threads are left running, the JVM may stop them
     *   when the main program finishes.
     *
     * In this example, the two threads are marked as daemon threads,
     * so they may not complete their full loop before the program exits.

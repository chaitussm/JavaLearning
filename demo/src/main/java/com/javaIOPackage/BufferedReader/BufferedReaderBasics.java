     *
     * We can use BufferedReader to read character data from the file , the main advantage of the BufferedReader when compared with 
     * FileReader is we can read data line-by-line in addition to character by character 
     * Constructors
     * BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r);
     * BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Reader r, int bufferSize);
     * NOTE: BufferedReader cant communicate directly with the file and it can communicate via some reader Object 
     * Methods 
     * int read()
     * int read(char[] ch)
     * void close()
     * String readLine() : It attempts to read the next line from the file and returns it if the nextlien is not available then this method 
     * returns null 
     * NOTE: whenever we are closing the BufferedReader automatically underlying FileReader will be closed and we are not required to close explicitly.
     * NOTE: The most enhanced reader to read character data from the file is BufferedReader

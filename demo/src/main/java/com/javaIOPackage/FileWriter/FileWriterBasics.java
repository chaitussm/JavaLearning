     * We can use FileWriter to write character data to the file
     * FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String fileName)
     * FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f)
     * The above FileWriter constructors meant for overriding of existing data instead of overriding if we want append operation 
     * then we have to create FileWriter by using the following constructors 
     * FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(String filename, boolean append)
     * FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(File f, boolean append)
     * NOTE: If the specified file is not already available then all the above constructors will create that file
     * write(int ch) : To write a single character 
     * write(char[] ch) : to write any array of characters 
     * write(String s) : to write String to the file
     * flush() to give the guranteethat total including last character will be written to the file 
     * close() to close the writer 
     * The main problem with the FileWriter is we have to insert line separator '/n' manually
     * which is varied from one OS to other OS  which is difficult for programmer 
     * We can solve this issue by using BufferedWriter and PrintWriter

     * PrintWriter: it is most enhanced writer to write character data data to the file 
     * The main advantage of PrintWriter over FileWriter and BufferedWriter is we can write any type of primitive data directly to the file 
     * Constructors
     * PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(String filename);
     * PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(File file);
     * PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(Writer w);
     * PrintWriter can communicate directly with the file and can communicate via some Writer Object also 
     * Methods 
     * write(int ch);
     * write(char[] ch);
     * write(String s);
     * flush();
     * close();
     * print(char ch);
     * print(int i);
     * print(double d);
     * print(boolean b);
     * print(String s);
     * println(char ch);
     * println(int i);
     * println(double d);
     * println(boolean b);
     * println(String s);
     * write(100): here the corresponding chartacter 'd' will be added to the file 
     * print(100): here the int value 100 will be added to the file directly 
     * NOTE: The most enhances writer to write character data to the file is PrintWriter whereas the most enhanaced reader to read character data from
     * the file is BufferedReader
     * NOTE: In general we can use readers and writers to handle character data (text data) , whereas we can use Streams to handle binary data 
     * (like images, videos , pdfs files , audio files and video files)
     * We can use OutputStream to write binary data to the file InputStream to read binary data form the file

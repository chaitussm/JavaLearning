    /*
     * String Constant Pool requirement 
     * In our program if a String Object is repeatedly required then it is not recommended to create 
     * separate Object for every requirement because it creates performance and memory problems 
     * instead of creating a separate Object for every requirement we have to create only one Object and we can reuse the same 
     * Object for every requirement so that performance and mermorty utilization will be improved 
     * this thing is possible because of SCP , hence the main advantages of SCP are memory utilization and performance will be improved  
     * But the main problem with SCP is , as several references pointing to the same Object, by using one reference if we are trying to 
     * change the content then remaining references will be effected to overcome this problem SUN people implemented Strings Objects as 
     * Immutable i.e once we create String Object we can't perform any changes in the existing Object if we are trying to perform any changes 
     * with those changes a new Object will be created. Hence for the SCP is the onyl reason for the immutability of the String Objects 
     * 
     * String Buffer 
     * But in StringBuffer there is no concept like SCP , hence for every requirement a separate Object will be created
     * By using one reference if we trying to change the content then there is no effect on remaining references 
     * Hence immutability concept is not required for the StringBuffer

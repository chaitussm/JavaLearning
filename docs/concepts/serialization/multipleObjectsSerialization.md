## Part 1 — sequenceOfMultpleObjects.java

**File:** [sequenceOfMultpleObjects.java](../../../demo/src/main/java/com/advanced/serialization/sequenceOfMultpleObjects.java)

### Concept

> A single `ObjectOutputStream` can write several objects back-to-back into the same file. There is no built-in index or count stored in the file — the reader **must** call `readObject()` the same number of times, in the same order, as the writer called `writeObject()`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as main()
    participant OOS as ObjectOutputStream
    participant Disk as multiple-objects.ser
    participant OIS as ObjectInputStream

    Main->>OOS: writeObject(dog)
    OOS->>Disk: bytes for Dog
    Main->>OOS: writeObject(cat)
    OOS->>Disk: bytes for Cat
    Main->>OIS: readObject() #1
    OIS->>Disk: read first record
    OIS-->>Main: Dog
    Main->>OIS: readObject() #2
    OIS->>Disk: read second record
    OIS-->>Main: Cat
```text

- Both `Dog` and `Cat` are empty marker classes that just implement `Serializable` with a `serialVersionUID`.
- Casting `(Dog) input.readObject()` on the *first* call and `(Cat) input.readObject()` on the *second* call only works because the caller already knows the exact write order in advance.
- If the order were swapped on read, the first object really is a `Dog`, so casting it to `Cat` throws `ClassCastException`.

### Verified Output

```text
First object: Dog
Second object: Cat
```text

## Part 2 — instanceOfMultipleObjects.java

**File:** [instanceOfMultipleObjects.java](../../../demo/src/main/java/com/advanced/serialization/instanceOfMultipleObjects.java)

### Concept

> When the reader does **not** know (or doesn't want to hard-code) the exact type at each stream position, read every object as plain `Object`, then use `instanceof` to safely discover the real type before casting and calling type-specific methods.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Create Dog, Cat, Student (all Serializable)"] --> B["Write all three, in order,\nto object-graph.ser"]
    B --> C["Read back 3x as Object\n(firstObject, secondObject, thirdObject)"]
    C --> D["handleDeserializedObjects(...) varargs loop"]
    D --> E{"instanceof check\nper object"}
    E -->|Dog| F["cast to Dog -> dog.bark()"]
    E -->|Cat| G["cast to Cat -> cat.meow()"]
    E -->|Student| H["cast to Student -> student.study()"]
```

### Why `instanceof` is required here
- `readObject()`'s return type is `Object` — the compiler doesn't know which subtype came back at runtime.
- `Object` doesn't declare `bark()`, `meow()`, or `study()` — calling them requires a cast to the specific class first.
- `instanceof` checks the object's **actual runtime type** before casting, avoiding an unsafe/blind cast that could throw `ClassCastException`.
- The varargs helper `handleDeserializedObjects(Object... objects)` lets one loop process any number of mixed-type objects instead of writing repetitive per-object code.

### Verified Output

```text
Object received: Dog
Dog-specific method: bark()
Object received: Cat
Cat-specific method: meow()
Object received: Student
Student-specific method: study()
```

### Part 1 vs. Part 2 — when to use which
|                                                      | Part 1 (`sequenceOfMultpleObjects`)    | Part 2 (`instanceOfMultipleObjects`) |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Reader knows the type at each position ahead of time | ✅ Yes — casts directly                 | ❌ No — discovers type at runtime     |
| Safety mechanism                                     | None (relies on programmer discipline) | `instanceof` before every cast       |
| Best for                                             | Fixed, well-known schemas              | Polymorphic / mixed-type streams     |

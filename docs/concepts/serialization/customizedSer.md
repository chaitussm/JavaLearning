## Source and Output Locations

Java source file:

```text
demo/src/main/java/com/advanced/serialization/customizedSerialization/customizedSer.java
```text

Serialized output file created by the current program:

```text
demo/sample-data/serialization/custom,ser
```text

The comma in `custom,ser` is part of the current filename. The extension is only a naming convention; `.ser` or `.dat` would also work.

## Classes Used

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class customizedSer
  class account {
    +String username = "Rama"
    +transient String password = "Sita"
  }
  customizedSer --> account : contains
```

The `account` class extends `serializeBase`, so it inherits the common serialization helper methods. It also implements customized serialization callbacks named `writeObject()` and `readObject()`.

## Why Customized Serialization Is Needed

Normally, Java's default serialization writes non-transient fields and skips transient fields.

```java
String username = "Rama";       // Written normally
transient String password = "Sita"; // Skipped normally
```text

The password is marked `transient` so its plain value is not written automatically. The custom callback writes a transformed representation instead.

## Complete Execution Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["main()"] --> B["Create account a1"]
  B --> C["Open custom,ser for writing"]
  C --> D["writeObject(a1) called by JVM"]
  D --> E["defaultWriteObject()\nusername written, password skipped"]
  D --> F["encryptPwd(password)\n'Sita' -> 'U2l0YQ=='"]
  F --> G["os.writeObject(encryptedText)"]
  G --> H["Close output streams"]
  H --> I["Open custom,ser for reading"]
  I --> J["readObject() called by JVM"]
  J --> K["defaultReadObject()\nusername restored, password null"]
  J --> L["is.readObject() -> 'U2l0YQ=='"]
  L --> M["decryptPwd() -> 'Sita'"]
  M --> N["password assigned restored value"]
  N --> O["Print: Rama===Sita"]
```text

## Serialization Phase

The main method creates the object:

```java
account a1 = new account();
```text

Then it opens the output streams and writes the object:

```java
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(filename);
     ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos)) {
    oos.writeObject(a1);
}
```

When `oos.writeObject(a1)` runs, Java automatically looks for this private callback inside `account`:

```java
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream os)
```text

The callback is not called directly by `main()`. Java's serialization mechanism calls it automatically.

## What `defaultWriteObject()` Does

```java
os.defaultWriteObject();
```text

This asks Java to perform its normal serialization behavior for the current object:

- `username` is written because it is a normal field.
- `password` is skipped because it is `transient`.

After that, the program handles the password manually:

```java
String encryptedText = encryptPwd(password);
os.writeObject(encryptedText);
```text

The transformed password must be explicitly written because `password` itself was excluded by `transient`.

## Important Note About `encryptPwd()`

In the current `serializeBase` implementation, `encryptPwd()` uses Base64 encoding:

```java
Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(password.getBytes())
```text

Base64 is not encryption. It is an encoding technique that can be decoded by anyone.

```text
Original text:  Sita
Encoded text:  U2l0YQ==
Decoded text:  Sita
```text

This example is useful for learning customized serialization and callback methods, but real password protection should use a proper password-hashing or encryption design.

## Deserialization Phase

The program opens the serialized file for reading:

```java
try (FileInputStream fos = new FileInputStream(filename);
     ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fos)) {
    account a2 = (account) ois.readObject();
}
```text

When `ois.readObject()` runs, Java automatically calls:

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream is)
```text

The callback performs the reverse custom process.

## What `defaultReadObject()` Does

```java
is.defaultReadObject();
```text

This restores the fields that were written by `defaultWriteObject()`:

```text
username -> "Rama"
password -> not restored because it was transient
```text

Then the manually written transformed password is read:

```java
String encryptedpwd = (String) is.readObject();
```text

Finally, the value is decoded and assigned:

```java
password = decryptPwd(encryptedpwd);
```text

## Why the Write and Read Order Must Match

The custom stream contains data in this order:

```text
defaultWriteObject() data
transformed password
```text

The read callback must consume data in the same order:

```text
defaultReadObject() data
transformed password
```text

If `is.readObject()` is called before `defaultReadObject()`, or if the extra password value is not written, the stream becomes unbalanced and deserialization can fail.

## Expected Output

```text
Encoded: U2l0YQ==
Encrypted (Base64): U2l0YQ==
Decoded: Sita
Rama===Sita
```text

The final line proves that:

- `username` was restored by default serialization.
- `password` was restored manually by the custom callback.
- The transient field was not written automatically.

## Exception Handling

The current callbacks catch exceptions and print a short message:

```java
catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Unable to serialize : " + e.getMessage());
}
```

The main method also catches exceptions around file creation, stream handling, and object reading. These problems can include:

- `IOException` when a file cannot be opened or read.
- `ClassNotFoundException` when the serialized class cannot be found during reading.
- `NotSerializableException` when a required object is not serializable.
- `IllegalArgumentException` or decoding errors if transformed data is invalid.

## Final Summary

```text
Default serialization:
username is written
password is skipped because it is transient

Customized serialization:
username is written by defaultWriteObject()
password is converted and written manually

Customized deserialization:
username is restored by defaultReadObject()
converted password is read, decoded, and assigned manually

programmer cant calls private directly from outside of the class 
but JVM can call private methods directly from outside of the class
```

The central lesson is:

> `writeObject()` and `readObject()` are private callback methods that allow a class to add its own behavior around Java's default serialization process.

## Part 2 — normalSer.java: the baseline without customization

**File:** [normalSer.java](../../../demo/src/main/java/com/advanced/serialization/customizedSerialization/normalSer.java)

### Concept

> This is the "before" picture: `normalAccount` has the exact same shape as `account` (a normal `username` field and a `transient password` field) but defines **no** `writeObject()`/`readObject()` callbacks. Default serialization silently drops the transient field — there is no way to recover it after deserialization.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["new normalAccount()\nusername='Shiva', password='Sati'"] --> B["oos.writeObject(a1)\n(no custom callbacks defined)"]
    B --> C["Default serialization:\nusername written\npassword skipped (transient)"]
    C --> D["ois.readObject()\n-> normalAccount a2"]
    D --> E["a2.username = 'Shiva' (restored)\na2.password = null (never written, never restored)"]
    E --> F["print a2.username + '-----' + a2.password"]
```text

### Verified Output
```
Shiva-----null
```

### Part 1 vs. Part 2 — the direct comparison

|                                         | `normalSer.java` (Part 2) | `customizedSer.java` (Part 1)     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `writeObject()`/`readObject()` defined? | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                             |
| Transient `password` after deserialize  | `null` (lost)             | Restored via manual encode/decode |
| Output                                  | `Shiva-----null`          | `Rama===Sita`                     |

This pair proves the exact problem statement in `normalSer.java`'s own comment: *"During default serialization there may be a chance of loss of information because of transient keyword."* `customizedSer.java` is the fix.
